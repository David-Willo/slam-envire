small notes on what this api should actually be able to do:

- encode hard geometric relationships between layers using FrameNodes. This
  is only possible in a tree. Maybe look at the possiblity of adding soft
  constraints later on.
- encode procedural relationsships between layers in an Operator Graph. 
- think about how to handle things like ICP and SLAM, which don't actually
  change the layers, but the FrameNodes. They could be operators, but more
  likely something like solver (?).

test cases that should be handled in the early phase

- load/save scan files
- load/save ply files
- load/save scene files (in Environment)
- apply scanmeshing to scan files
- list layers in the environment
- list framenodes in the environment
- apply icp to TriMeshes
- implement icp stopping criteria 

- gui based on ogre that can do what pointcloud app does
- fix memory leak
- make scene file hierarchical and add operators (make it save the whole
  state)
